Perfected dalliance

Now, at age 32, Alvi circled back to his biotech project after having left the idea dormant for more than a decade, allowing it to germinate, like seeds sown in fallow ground. If those seeds could take root despite the unfavorable conditions of benign neglect, then, in Alvi’s valuation, they were worth pursuing. It meant they were durable.

Today would be zero-day, the day that Alvi’s tame temperament acquiesced to arete. Today he would give an address on his proprietary literary-genetic sequencing code. 

The fifteen lines of code exercised a concise algorithmic function, sifting through an input text, and extracting and cataloguing letters which matched those used to abbreviate the nucleotides found in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The catalogue, in the form of a list, was then adjoined into a single string of text. That string of text, which could be thousands of characters long, could be fed into a genomic database, such as the National Library of Medicine’s Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), and compared to a litany of genetic sequences researchers had gleaned from flora and fauna found on our planet. Alvi’s code, which he called “deignos”, he felt was a gift from the heavens that the powers had condescended, lowered themselves, to bestow to him.

It was for his belief Charis⁴—totem bodhi⁵— edified Alvi’s agency, pressing to spruce up the code, a reward for his enthusiastic faith. This personification of grace strengthened Alvi’s resolve, granting him essential knowledge and shielding him from the wrath of his foes, preserving his hope and guaranteeing the longevity of his peace through friendship. But not unconditionally.
